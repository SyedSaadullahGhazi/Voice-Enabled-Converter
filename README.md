# Voice-Enabled-Converter
The Voice Enabled Converter is a comprehensive application designed to perform conversions across various units of measurement, including temperature, weight, length, pressure, and time. Developed using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface, the converter allows users to input values manually or utilize voice commands for hands-free operation. The application integrates speech recognition functionality through the speech_recognition library, enabling it to listen to user commands, process them, and perform the appropriate conversions. For temperature, users can convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin; for weight, the options include Kilograms, Grams, Pounds, and Ounces. The length conversion feature supports Metres, Kilometres, Inches, Feet, Yards, and Miles, while the pressure converter works with Pascal, Bar, Pound per Square Inch, Std. Atmosphere, and Torr. Time conversions can be done between Hours, Minutes, Seconds, Milliseconds, Days, and Weeks. Each unit conversion is accompanied by a dropdown menu for selecting the desired unit and an entry field for inputting values. Additionally, the interface includes a 'Voice Command' button that initiates voice recognition, making it convenient for users to interact with the application verbally. The app is designed with an intuitive layout and aesthetic styling, featuring background images and customizable widgets for a seamless userÂ experience.
